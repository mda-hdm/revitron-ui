Installation 
============

The Revitron UI extension requires the `Revitron <https://revitron.readthedocs.io/>`_. library to be installed 
as well as a pyRevit extension. It is possible to install both extensions manually or bundled with a custom 
`fork <https://github.com/revitron/pyRevit>`_ of pyRevit including the project based package manager 
`RPM <https://github.com/revitron/rpm/blob/master/README.md>`_. 
Generally it is recommendend to install the bundled version as described below.

.. attention:: The bundle installer as well as the Revitron package manager are using `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to manage dependencies.
   Please make sure that **Git** is installed properly on your system before installing Revitron.
